# nutshell

Nutshell (as in `in a nutshell`, not a completely new `shell`) is a programming language meant to be customizable.
You can change your coding style to anything that suits you (but not too far for now).
For example: You can introduce 3 ways of writing else ifs, just in a `nutshell` file.
